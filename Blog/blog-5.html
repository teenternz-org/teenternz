        HOW TO FIND YOUR PASSION
    </h1>

    <p id="Content">
        Passion is a feeling of intense enthusiasm or desire for someone or something.
        Passion can vary from eager interest in or admiration for an idea, proposal,
        or cause; to enthusiastic enjoyment of an interest or activity; to strong attraction,
        excitement, or emotion towards a person. If you're reading this you might know how
        to know your passion so let's know about passion:
        <br><br><br>

        <b>Why is passion important to you?</b>

        <br><br><br>

        A passion gives you a reason to keep learning and to work toward mastery. It can often give you a reason to
        travel, and therefore to have the new experiences so key to happiness. It gives you something in common with
        other people, and so fosters social bonds. It gives you purpose.


        <br><br><br>


        <b> ✓ If you haven't found your passion, these might be possible reasons for it</b>

        <br> <br>

        1. If you already know what you want to do but you’re afraid to pursue it, you don’t have to quit all your
        responsibilities in life. Do it on the side or free up time for it. Do it because that’s what matters to you.

        <br> <br>

        2. You haven’t found your passion yet, you haven’t explored enough. To explore, you need courage. With courage,
        you try new things. You’re not afraid to look stupid or make mistakes. Keep playing with life and stop obsessing
        about passion.

        <br><br>

        3. You might be stereotyped by your family or friends that is creating a barrier for you to become passionate.


        <br><br><br>

        <b>Let's talk about some ways which can help you to find your passion.</b>

        <br><br><br>

        <b>1. Brainstorm the activities that you find meaningful:
        </b>

        <br><br>

        Monitor your daily activities and find out which activity or work you love to do everyday that must be
        productive and beneficial for you in future. It can be your hobby. Ask your family and friends about which topic
        you talk about the most. Focus on yourself and go ahead.
        <br>
        “A life spent making mistakes is not only more honorable, but more useful than a life spent doing nothing.”


        <br><br><br>

        <b>2. Research On Yourself:</b>
        <br><br>

        Research on yourself and on your interests. If you examine your interests in a good way I am damn sure that you
        would find your passion. Talk to your parents or teachers and ask them for your help if you face any issue as
        they are your closest ones who can tell you about yourself.

        <br>
        "Do your own research. Enlighten yourself. It is better to know than to assume"

        <br><br><br>

        <b>3. Consider your talent: </b>
        <br><br>

        If you are passionate about something or you like to do something productive naturally, consider it as a clue
        for your future. If you are skilled in childhood, it can be your career.

        <br>
        “Talent hits a target no one else can hit."

        <br><br><br>

        <b>4. Look for common things in your hobbies or interests: </b>

        <br><br>
        You do activities that you like the most and make you feel good or joyful. Try to find common things among them.
        They may be connected to each other in any aspect.

        <br><br><br>

        <b>
            5. Shortlist Your Interests:
        </b>
        <br><br>
        As we talked about finding interests earlier, you may have noted down somewhere. You may have multiple interests
        no doubts so try to shortlist the interests that are more important and valuable to you at that time. Following
        multiple interests will let you go down and you will not be able to pursue one of them so focus on only
        important ones.

        <br><br><br>

        <b>6. Explore Your desires :</b>
        <br><br>

        As all of us have some desires or goals in our life. So think about the work that can lead you to your desires
        and can make you successful in your life.

        <br>
        “The world is little, people are little, human life is little. There is only one big thing — desire."

        <br><br><br>


        <b>7. Never Give Up: </b>

        <br><br>

        Never give up your interests or goals. Don't let anyone demotivate you. Whenever you feel demotivated just think
        about your goals in life.

        <br>
        “You just can't beat the person who won't give up.”


        <br><br><br>

        <b>8.Find your "Why" :</b>
        <br><br>

        Do you think I am kidding? No I am not. We all have a "why" for which we live and survive in even the worst days
        of our life. Think "Why" you are living. Find your purpose of living.
        <br>
        "He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.”

        <br><br><br>

        <b> 10. Be enthusiastic and positive:</b>

        <br><br>
        Ok, I know this above term is easy to say but very hard to imply in life but believe me it will work. Don't
        think about negative things, just focus on the positive side that will keep you going throughout your life.
        Don't consider yourself less valued. Everyone has their own specialities and qualities :)

        <br>
        “Great things happen to those who don't stop believing, trying, learning, and being grateful.”


        <br><br><br>

        <b>11. Invest time in your interests:</b>
        <br><br>
        Give time to your interests and develop them to master them. Make a timetable or a schedule and give equal time
        to all your interests.

        <br>

        " An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.

        <br><br><br>

        <b>
            12. Experiment and learn from failure:
        </b>

        <br><br>

        As you know your interests, you can start some things to know more about it. You can start an organisation for
        that particular field. Believe me it's not a big deal to start any organisation during teenage. Just believe in
        yourself. Also if you do experiments you might face failure, not all times but sometimes, but remember you don't
        have to give up and learn from that failure. Examine what you did wrong that led you to failure and rectify the
        mistake and make a new beginning.

        <br>

        “It always seems impossible until it's done.”
