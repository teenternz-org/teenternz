        HOW TO DEAL WITH STRESS AND STILL ENJOY OUR HIGHSCHOOL LIFE
    </h1>

    <p id="Content">
        Anything that your mind says has an identical response to the body cells. That‚Äôs why stress is the response your
        body gives physically or mentally to a challenging situation in your life, that response is dependent on how you
        think of the situation in your mind, that's why stress can be positive or negative. If we take things positively
        the symptoms lead to making you more productive actually. But in some conditions, the situation which we are in
        can be out of our control and at that time we have to maintain our responsibility towards it.
        <br><br><br>

        <b>Mostly there are a lot of things and stressful situations that
            are going on in a teenager‚Äôs life which might be a reason to
            create stress like.</b>

        <br><br><br>

        1. In Schools, we might feel the pressure of exams and can lead to bad competition.
        <br><br>


        2. But you have to make sure whatever you have selected should be unique. And it can be any topic in demand or
        which is a requirement for the people who live in your area so, the students will be excited to take part in the
        organization and school should also agree to your proposal.

        <br> <br>

        3. Pressure from family for grades or other family issues.

        <br> <br>

        4. Pressure to build new relationships.

        <br><br>

        5. having toxic friends and relationships results in stress and less support.

        <br><br>

        6. bullies and problematic teachers, etc.


        <br><br>

        all of these things cause a lack of confidence, anxiety, depression, and stress.
        <br><br><br>
        A very very important thing to understand while handling stress is that we always take the reaction coming from
        stress as fear or anxiety, try changing this feeling with curiosity. For example, if you are in an exam hall and
        you are slowly starting to feel pressure and fear, and other symptoms of stress.
        OBSERVE, observe the reactions that your body is giving to you in this situation your heart is racing, hand
        sweating, etc.

        <br><br><br>
        generate curiosity within, about how the paper will be good for you and how you will get good grades, this will
        help you control your reaction and bring it from dangerous to normal or healthy stress. Observe the things that
        you do which helps you to calm your symptoms and use them in other situations as well.

        <br><br><br>
        In our teenage years, we have many changes happening in our daily life for the first time and we don‚Äôt know how
        to cope with these situations, because of this it is observed that teenagers experience stress and anxiety more.
        But in these worsened situations some teenagers go for the wrong side of coping with stress like drugs, wrong
        thoughts, etc. please don‚Äôt cope with your problems in a way that will damage your life there are other ways in
        which you can do so. And here are some methods that you can imply in your schedule so you minimize or cope with
        stress and enjoy your high school life.

        <br><br><br>

        1. <b>Visualize; </b> now if you know that situation is going to come where you can get stressed. You have to
        imagine
        yourself in that situation whether it feels bad to be in it and think how you will react or do the things in
        that situation. ‚ÄúFirst thing and then do it‚Äù. This will help you make a practice to cope with things and make
        them happen as you want them to be and control your reaction towards it
        <br><br>

        2. <b> Organize; </b>many of us get overwhelmed by the curriculum we have to cover and we also cannot cope with
        time
        management when we have a lot of things to do, in situations like these you have to organize. This is the
        category where a lot of things fit so,

        <br><br>

        Start from small things like pack your things beforehand going to school or exam.
        <br><br>
        Make a task board where what you have to cover for a specific exam is written and color code it as per the
        difficulty level.
        <br><br>
        Make a timetable for busy schedules and cut on the classes or things that you think are extra.
        <br><br>
        Keep the place where you work organized. An organized workspace helps in clearing your mind and increasing
        productivity.
        <br><br><br>
        3. <b> Deep breathing; </b>Always helps deep breathing and self-talk make a great combination in stressful
        situations
        because we are the ones who can control ourselves. This helps us calm down more effectively in aggressive
        reactions by our parasympathetic nervous system (rest and digest function) which helps the sympathetic nervous
        system(flight or fight response) calm down.

        <br><br><br>

        4. <b>Exercise;</b> move yourself, staying in one place or doing the same things daily can frustrate us
        exercising and
        giving movement to your body is very important to keep your physical and mental state healthy. You can go for a
        walk outside or you can do different types of exercise like dancing, workout, running, athletics, anything that
        you feel joy while doing. Take out time from your schedule for things like this you can remove your one class or
        subject from the time you want to do these things but don‚Äôt burden yourself.
        <br><br><br>

        5. <b> Self-love; </b> if you are stressed because of bullying or people who make you feel low like toxic
        friends or body
        shaming, etc. First, learn to love yourself as you are, when you will love yourself what others say does not
        make any difference in your life. Do skincare, read books, go on a self date, cook your favorite food, be a
        plant parent, get a pet. These things will help you feel better. Don‚Äôt give those people any importance, what
        matters in your life is just what you think and decide to be.


        <br><br><br>

        6. <b>Talk;</b> suffering can be made easy by telling someone about it to someone. If we cannot find a solution
        to the problem the person who we tell can help. Also when we talk to someone and find that there is a sense of
        understanding between us we get to know that we are not only the stuck ones. Having someone standing to support
        us is a great thing and this can happen if you share what you think with others. try Including your family,
        friends, the people you love the ones you trust.

        <br><br><br>

        7. <b> Accept;</b> lastly, sometimes things are not in our control so accept the situation you are in don‚Äôt run
        away from it. Doing everything is not important doing the things that make you happy and giving your full
        potential to them is worth your time.

        <br><br><br>
        These methods also help you to practically enjoy your high school life while relieving your stress, like for
        example, when you talk to someone share your feelings with them this will help you to make friends and discover
        people who have interests and problems like you.


        <br><br><br>
        And at last here are the three E‚Äôs which you can imply in your high school life to enjoy it to the fullest.

        <br><br><br>

        <b> Enjoying - </b> now we all have 1-2 or more things that we love to do it like a hobby, always keep taking
        classes or doing the things which you like along the excessive study schedule which is equal to maintain your
        interest in you school years

        <br><br>

        <b> Embrace the competition - </b> school is mostly about competition which might create stress but make it your
        way of doing things through HEALTHY competition don‚Äôt hurt yourself and others through that.

        <br><br>

        <b>Ending - </b> we always want things to end happily whatever the process is. For example, if you fight with
        your closest friend it is ok to not talk for some time but don‚Äôt only expect others to make things right you can
        be the one to take the first step and make your ending good. Because things like friendship are very important
        in school life
