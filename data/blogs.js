    article: 'In our lives, we all have experienced a certain trait that sometimes makes us feel stuck in one place. For instance, when trying to complete an assignment, you have the urge of possibly doing it later and just doing some other activity to keep your head out of it. This certain urge would be defined as procrastination, which delays a task to either put it off in a last-second or any other time before the deadline. Sometimes, procrastination could also be about persuading yourself to completely finish it off as it would be much beneficial for your time management. But the truth is, it is seemingly difficult to overcome it as there are loads of other activities to do instead of the initial task that you were supposed to do.<br /> <br /> Procrastination often comes around when you’re doing a school task or any sort of work-related assignment. You were assigned to finish it before the deadline when suddenly your mind has told you that such task could be finished later on. As the youth of our generation, we have certain distractions that comes in our way, especially the idea of social media platforms and more modern technological advancements that includes the virtual and non-virtual spaces. Besides the evolution, we sometimes lack self-discipline where we often have a hard time controlling ourselves into doing something else. This could either be the cause of the lack of motivation or the pressure that we put ourselves into. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, others identify procrastination as “laziness” which isn’t at all. Its mostly the desire of simply completing a task but could be difficult to maintain due to the time management skills or the causes that were mentioned above. As trying to balance your tasks, its also difficult to decide whether doing a task would be worth it, hence, you start to doubt that doing so would completely benefit you. This would be known as a decision paralysis where you often have a lot of freedom to make your decisions which could reflect your actions when doing your work. Procrastination is difficult to overcome as it ignores the value of time and the consequences you would get in the near future. <br /> <br /> Although procrastination will live a long in our lives, there will be some occassions where we would have to go through it in order to productively finish the tasks that was either given to us or simply to get it done right away. Hence, to slowly fight over procrastination, here are some tips to go over it: <br /> <br /> 1. Time Management: As always, managing your time will benefit the situation by understanding the consequences that could happen if its done on time or not. Hence, try organizing a list or notes that could balance the tasks from a certain time period. For instance, organizing when and what time you should begin your tasks such as prioritizing it based on the significance and deadline it is. It is also important to take breaks in which you should keep in mind. <br /> <br /> 2. Minizime Distractions: Having to limit the distractions would help you focus upon doing your tasks such as closing off social media platforms, streaming services, and other activities that would distract you. To slowly limit them, you can start of by shutting them down by replacing with an easy task to finish within an hour. <br /> <br /> 3. Create a Planner: Although this is similar towards time management, creating a planner could possibly be planned a day, week, or month ahead in order to see what goes on during that time period. Thus, having planners such as a to-do list and a monthly planner would see the overall tasks that needs to be done within the deadline. You can either create a template for yourselves or use Canva, Goodnotes, and other Google templates to prepare so. <br /> <br /> 4. Have a Reward: Having to remind yourselves to constantly finish your tasks would be hectic but rewarding yourself in the end of the day would be the finishing touch of your duties. Thus, this could motivate you to keep going and to focus on completing your productive day! <br /> <br /> 5. Improve Your Routine: Lastly, improving your life style would benefit your productivity as it would create a healthy environment when trying to limit yourself from procrastination. Therefore, try sleeping early, eat properly, and prioritizing what needs to be done could help organize the essential activities. Planning this life style would not only improve your productivity but als your character. <br /> <br /> Procrastination may be a difficult obstacle to overcome, but at the end of the day, it is just an urge that wants you to keep away from doing the productive tasks to go on. <br /> <br /> <span className="font-semibold">References</span> <br /> Schicker A. <Link href="https://procrastination.com/what-is-procrastination" passHref><a className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">What Is PROCRASTINATION and How Can You Overcome It? </a></Link>Procrastination.com.

    article: 'Graduation is that time of your life where progression has started to come where new beginnings and the first chapter of your story would take off towards the aftermath of your school life. This could be a primary or secondary school. However, there is one part of evolution where teenagers are going through which is the aftermath of high school. Now, there are different perspectives coming from a graduate whether they have a plan or not. Generally, society has placed this mindset where once you have graduated from high school, your new chapter starts which is a university (or college). In some cases. it is not the same for others. A plan is evolved but it does not necessarily mean going to a university right away but a break from it which some label as “the gap year”. <br /><br />A gap year is defined as a year-long break where students use this chance to either take a break mentally or physically from school. It is also known as the sabbatical year where gap year students would enhance their skills through a series of open opportunities. This could apply after high school and college but in this case, it’s more of the aftermath from high school. Unfortunately, there are a lot of stereotypical profiles against being a gap year student. For instance, some would label them as “lazy” because of the lack of motivation they had over the past twelve to thirteen years of educational curriculums. Some would say that being a gap year student is just a “waste of time” because they are not benefiting the year/s they have left just to continue studying for the future purpose. These statements have been acknowledging by several people who shame students for not going to a university right away after their secondary education. However, there are emphasizes on why and how gap year is actually benefiting the students after high school. <br /><br />But firstly, it is important to recognize personally why you think you should take a gap year? Being a gap year student has certain obstacles along the way and although it may be a break for your needs, there are some other reasonings for others to take such as possibly working, traveling, setting up a business, etc. There are countless opportunities when being a gap year student, hence, it is important to understand why you will need to take a break in the first place. Secondly, being in school for almost your entire life has been a challenge for most students especially to those who are dealing with personal struggles along the way. Taking the opportunity during the gap year would ensure the mental capability for handling further decisions in the future. Some would use the break to destress from all the work that needs to be produced such as recovering from the academic burnout that would be displayed on tests, quizzes, or homework. It is mentally and energy-draining which, therefore, students are recommended to take if necessary. Additionally, it gives them time to learn more about themselves and how would they benefit them in the future. Thirdly, other students take time to develop new skills possibly related to home education or work experience. As mentioned, they take some time to explore various opportunities that surround them to extend their knowledge about the society we live in. On certain occasions, it would also give others the opportunity to grow independent and to learn to cope up with what is needed for themselves. Thus, work opportunities or related experiences could enhance their skills which could benefit their resumes or other standards required in the upcoming fields. Lastly, this may be repetitive but taking some time for yourself such as determining your goals and how this could evolve you as a person may change some viewpoints from yourself. It is easy to get long in countless pages of your life thus, spending the time during the gap year could potentially help you determine what’s best for you by setting some goals. <br /><br />The reasons for taking a gap year are beneficial towards a student who experienced countless burnouts or energy-drained issues that some schools have left them with. Taking a gap year before entering university could make a student increase their self-awareness or confidence as it would make them feel a sense of ownership in the future. It gives them time to reflect and understand their flexibility when handling time management. Taking a gap year is not fully easy for a student to comprehend as it will give them a better idea to understand the sense of being focused or in their own field. Their individuality and independence would make them stronger as they build their awareness towards going to a university. There have been surveys conducted coming from students who are taking a gap year. 98% have mentioned it had helped them with their self-confidence whereas 93% have increased their communication skills. These aspects helped each individual gap year student for growing further to develop their skills. Being a gap year student is not in all an issue, it is what makes an individual grow and prepare for what comes in the future. In fact, they can take as much time as they need to further develop because a college or university institution will still manage to be there. It will be there to develop others’ careers whereas gap year students could take the time they need. The pressure that comes along these individuals has given them a huge block on their backs that makes them carry throughout their lives. The stigma needs to end where individuals have the right to what is best for them and for their future, especially those coming from years of secondary school. <br /><br /><span className="font-semibold">References</span> <br />Wikipedia Contributors. <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_year" passHref><a className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Gap year.</a></Link> Wikipedia.

    article: 'Passion is a feeling of intense enthusiasm or desire for someone or something. Passion can vary from eager interest in or admiration for an idea, proposal, or cause; to enthusiastic enjoyment of an interest or activity; to strong attraction, excitement, or emotion towards a person. If you&apos;re reading this you might know how to know your passion so let&apos;s know about passion: <br /><br /><br /> <b>Why is passion important to you?</b> <br /><br /><br /> A passion gives you a reason to keep learning and to work toward mastery. It can often give you a reason to travel, and therefore to have the new experiences so key to happiness. It gives you something in common with other people, and so fosters social bonds. It gives you purpose. <br /><br /><br /> <b> ✓ If you haven&apos;t found your passion, these might be possible reasons for it</b> <br /> <br /> 1. If you already know what you want to do but you’re afraid to pursue it, you don’t have to quit all your responsibilities in life. Do it on the side or free up time for it. Do it because that’s what matters to you. <br /> <br /> 2. You haven’t found your passion yet, you haven’t explored enough. To explore, you need courage. With courage, you try new things. You’re not afraid to look stupid or make mistakes. Keep playing with life and stop obsessing about passion. <br /><br /> 3. You might be stereotyped by your family or friends that is creating a barrier for you to become passionate. <br /><br /><br /> <b>Let&apos;s talk about some ways which can help you to find your passion.</b> <br /><br /><br /> <b>1. Brainstorm the activities that you find meaningful: </b> <br /><br /> Monitor your daily activities and find out which activity or work you love to do everyday that must be productive and beneficial for you in future. It can be your hobby. Ask your family and friends about which topic you talk about the most. Focus on yourself and go ahead. <br /> “A life spent making mistakes is not only more honorable, but more useful than a life spent doing nothing.” <br /><br /><br /> <b>2. Research On Yourself:</b> <br /><br /> Research on yourself and on your interests. If you examine your interests in a good way I am damn sure that you would find your passion. Talk to your parents or teachers and ask them for your help if you face any issue as they are your closest ones who can tell you about yourself. <br /> &quot;Do your own research. Enlighten yourself. It is better to know than to assume&quot; <br /><br /><br /> <b>3. Consider your talent: </b> <br /><br /> If you are passionate about something or you like to do something productive naturally, consider it as a clue for your future. If you are skilled in childhood, it can be your career. <br /> &quot;Talent hits a target no one else can hit.&quot; <br /><br /><br /> <b>4. Look for common things in your hobbies or interests: </b> <br /><br /> You do activities that you like the most and make you feel good or joyful. Try to find common things among them. They may be connected to each other in any aspect. <br /><br /><br /> <b> 5. Shortlist Your Interests: </b> <br /><br /> As we talked about finding interests earlier, you may have noted down somewhere. You may have multiple interests no doubts so try to shortlist the interests that are more important and valuable to you at that time. Following multiple interests will let you go down and you will not be able to pursue one of them so focus on only important ones. <br /><br /><br /> <b>6. Explore Your desires :</b> <br /><br /> As all of us have some desires or goals in our life. So think about the work that can lead you to your desires and can make you successful in your life. <br /> &quot;The world is little, people are little, human life is little. There is only one big thing — desire.&quot; <br /><br /><br /> <b>7. Never Give Up: </b> <br /><br /> Never give up your interests or goals. Don&apos;t let anyone demotivate you. Whenever you feel demotivated just think about your goals in life. <br /> “You just can&apos;t beat the person who won&apos;t give up.” <br /><br /><br /> <b>8.Find your &quot;Why&quot; :</b> <br /><br /> Do you think I am kidding? No I am not. We all have a &quot;why&quot; for which we live and survive in even the worst days of our life. Think &quot;Why&quot; you are living. Find your purpose of living. <br /> &quot;He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.&quot; <br /><br /><br /> <b> 10. Be enthusiastic and positive:</b> <br /><br /> Ok, I know this above term is easy to say but very hard to imply in life but believe me it will work. Don&apos;t think about negative things, just focus on the positive side that will keep you going throughout your life. Don&apos;t consider yourself less valued. Everyone has their own specialities and qualities :) <br /> “Great things happen to those who don&apos;t stop believing, trying, learning, and being grateful.” <br /><br /><br /> <b>11. Invest time in your interests:</b> <br /><br /> Give time to your interests and develop them to master them. Make a timetable or a schedule and give equal time to all your interests. <br /> &quot; An investment in knowledge pays the best interest. <br /><br /><br /> <b> 12. Experiment and learn from failure: </b> <br /><br /> As you know your interests, you can start some things to know more about it. You can start an organisation for that particular field. Believe me it&apos;s not a big deal to start any organisation during teenage. Just believe in yourself. Also if you do experiments you might face failure, not all times but sometimes, but remember you don&apos;t have to give up and learn from that failure. Examine what you did wrong that led you to failure and rectify the mistake and make a new beginning. <br /> “It always seems impossible until it&apos;s done.”'

    article: 'Passion is a feeling of intense enthusiasm or desire for someone or something. Trust in the team is the most important thing especially in the remote teams. In addition to trust, communication is no less important. If these two things can&apos;t be built, it&apos;s hard to find effectiveness in a team or organization Usually remote teams are more fun, because they have friends from a different city or country, but are often also constrained by language problems and personality that they have not known each other. Not infrequently quarrel, if this is already quite difficult to overcome them. <br /><br /> <b>So this is step by step for build good relationship remote team</b> <br /><br /> <b>1. Select Team Members Wisely </b> <br /><br /> Selecting team members is also very influential for effectiveness in remote teams. Discipline, creativity, responsibility and skills are needed in the team in order to maintain the organization. There are several things to consider when accepting remote team members, for example: <br /><br /> • Appropriate expertise <br /> • Have good communication skills <br /> • Fast response <br /> <br /><br /> <b>2. Clearly Define Work Direction</b> <br /><br /> Work direction is very influential on the productivity of team work. These team members can be held accountable for each of their respective performances. <br /><br /> Some examples for clearly define work directions for build remote teams effectively: <br /><br /> • Specific working hours every week <br /> • Where they have to collect tasks <br /> • Set deadlines for work <br /> • Hold a meeting to get to know each other <br /> • What platform will be used to communicate <br /><br /> There are many ways to make performance process well and make sure all team members communicate well <br /><br /><br /> <b>3. Maintain Communication Between Team Members</b> <br /><br /> Communication breakdown of team members is very influential in productivity and quality of work performance. If you don&apos;t want that to happen, you must actively involve the founder and the team. How to do it? <br /><br /> • Hold meetings monthly <br /> • Check-in with individual employees <br /><br /> Maintaining communication is the process of making sure everything is still on the page and can respond promptly to each other. <br /><br /><br /> <b> 3. Set up a Communication Platform </b> <br /><br /><br /> Communication is the key to the success in the teams especially the long distance team, but it is also a difficult challenge. <br /><br /> But in the digital era like now, everything is easy, you only need a signal and gadget service can already communicate with everyone, especially team members from all over the world. <br /><br /><br /> <b>4. Communication</b> <br /><br /> Remote communication eliminates visual cues and thus requires more effort to establish common ground. Unlike co-present partners, distributed team members cannot rely on gestures and facial expressions to direct the other’s attention and provide feedback on their understanding. <br /><br /><br /> <b>5. Watch Your Language</b> <br /><br /> It is not enough just to communicate either in the form of text or face to face. when they are in their respective zones so that they often hinder messages from a distance because remote work is not as easy as working in the office <br /><br /><br /> <b>6. Provide Tools for Teams</b> <br /><br /> Preparing the right tools can improve performance for the better. Providing software for teams remotely is important, but there is something even more important, do you know what? It is a necessary tool for individual work. Maybe it doesn&apos;t look so important but it will greatly affect the effectiveness of work. It&apos;s very important to make sure each team member has access to the existing tools or they want to set it up with their own account. <br /><br /><br /> <b>7. Determine Work Schedule</b> <br /><br /><br /> Determining the schedule is one way to determine the accountability of each member in realizing work expectations. In addition to making members responsible for their respective duties, this can also see the discipline of members in time. <br /><br /> When just accepting a new remote member, the founder must pay attention and confirm each process and work expectations and then communicate them well and clearly to each team member. There are many things that can increase the productivity and effectiveness of a remote team but these eight steps are where it all starts. <br /><br /> Advances from remote work add to the positive and negative aspects. And this is the reason why organizational founders strive to find the right tools to structure and distribute teams so that the organization will continue to grow. In addition, for many people working remotely is more comfortable because they are in their respective homes. Especially during the interview session, it feels easier than face-to-face interviews. <br /><br /> Apart from these eight steps as a starting point for effective remote team building, there are also benefits to joining a remote teams, some of them are: <br /><br /> • You can save money Because they work as a remote team working from their homes and using all the facilities they have free of charge. <br /><br /> • Team members will be more productive Working as a remote team can choose the work they like and thus they will be easier, faster and enjoy their work. <br /><br /> • You can access global talent pool Remote teams consist of people from different countries and cities, so when we join we can see the talents of different people and we can learn that so we will get new experiences.'

    article: 'In this article we are going to tell you <b>how important it is to take a break and how to take an effective and productive break.</b> Now you are working continuously for a whole day, week, month, you have started working with your full energy and now as you do these things for a long time you feel exhausted you are in need of some recharge, this is the time you have to listen to your body and take a break. We all know that you have to sleep at night when you are awake for the whole day. It is decided in nature itself that taking a break is important. That&apos;s why doctors say you have to take 7-8 hours of daily sleep to function properly. We do this every day, so why not do it while we work or study. <br /><br /><br /> <b>These are the reason why taking break is important ;</b> <br /><br /><br /> 1. We are not machines to work continuously and even these days machines like mobile phones, laptops, etc. need to be recharged when their battery exhausts. So, like we need food and water we need rest. <br /><br /> 2. It increases your productivity. You must have observed we feel really good in the mornings most of the time this is the result of taking a break. <br /><br /> 3. It is very important for your physical and mental health to take time out from your regular schedule and heal yourself from within. <br /><br /> 4. We get to observe the things which we cannot have observed in the rush of work. For example; when you are walking through a street in the morning to catch the bus you don’t see anything other than your goal, but try walking through the same path when you are free you will notice many beautiful things. And this is the way you enjoy your life from the small things around you. <br /><br /> 5. You get to recall the things you did or to understand the mistakes you are making in your daily schedule to find a better way to do things. <br /><br /> 6. This gives you time to take your hobbies other than your regular work and to do things you have wished in your bucket list if you are taking a longer break. <br /><br /> 7. If you are feeling stressed or have any mental health problems, breaks during the school or work helps you to calm yourself. This will make you think about all the situations and will give you time to work on this will make you stronger. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> There is a technique naturopathy doctors tell their patients to do which is water diet, what is water diet basically giving a break to your digestive system to remove all the toxic/unwanted/harmful things from your body. So that this method helps the patient to heal itself from within. But it is strictly above 18 so don’t try it at home. Here, we have to take the importance of taking rest or having a break. <br /><br /> <b> There can be many different types of breaks but here are three ways in which we will categories it based on the time it takes;</b> 1. Short or minute= these kinds of breaks you can use while studying or working. Your brain can work productively for 45 minutes as per the observations. If we want to be productive for more than 45 min you have to take a 15-20 min of break. <br /><br /> 2. Medium or weekly/monthly = this includes our weekly off during Sunday or any other day which your working schedule offers you or month ends. You have to use this day to give yourself complete rest and spend time with your family and friends, going somewhere nice to travel, etc. whatever makes you happy. <br /><br /> 3. Long yearly (bigger than a year if you need)= like academic breaks. Now, some people think academic breaks are just a waste of time. But they are needed not for everyone but for some people out there. So, if you want to take such breaks don’t listen to anyone and just take it because it might be important for you. <br /><br /><br /> If you want to take a break but don’t know how to make it less lazy and more productive All these things listed from the first have ways you can take a productive and effective break hidden in them. But here there are more ways and also some things given above stated in a simple manner to do so. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <b>1. Journaling </b> this will help you have a clear idea of things that you need to complete after the break is over and will help you think effectively. If you write about your feelings or events in the journal it will also help you be mentally stable and make you feel more happier when you will express your gratitude in it. <br /><br /><br /> <b>2. Observe your surrounding </b>Go for a walk outside if it is a short break. If it is a long one, go for a small vacation. If you cannot do that either just sit on your balcony or any open space and observe this will help you breathe good air and be refreshed. <br /><br /><br /> 3. Now a scientific method for small breaks is taking caffeine. <b> Drinking coffee increases your energy level.</b> Also, eat something not junk but make it a bit healthy if you can go to a nearby restaurant or try a new café for change. Utilize your break to try new things around you. <br /><br /><br /> 4. Most people like to take a break by isolating themselves. You should also <b> try to socialize</b> with new people during breaks. This can make you understand people more and help you make new friends and gain opportunities. <br /><br /><br /> 5. You may also <b> talk to your friends or family </b>during that break. This will help you give time to your work and family, because many people fail to do these things they just get stuck in the work and forget about the family. Whether you are a teenager and live with your parents, build this habit of talking to the people in your house instead of scrolling through social media telling them your schedule and listening to their schedule. Take a social media break you know it’s benefits. <br /><br /><br /> 6. <b>Take a nap.</b> You can sleep for hours if it is a medium or long break but if you don’t want to do so, nothing is better than taking a power nap, find a good cozy spot in the house, set a timer on your phone for 25-30 minutes and sleep. This will help you to focus on your classes or work you are doing and won’t make you feel lazy during your productive hours. But don’t make it a habit. Exercise or meditation mainly keeps your body moving. Go for a walk, do a small yoga session, do whatever you like. If you are sitting in front of a screen or your book on the same spot for a long time this is necessary to keep you fit and working. Meditating will help you be more mentally stable if you are feeling low while working. <br /><br /><br /> 7. <b> Exercise or meditation </b> mainly keeps your body moving. Go for a walk, do a small yoga session, do whatever you like. If you are sitting in front of a screen or your book on the same spot for a long time this is necessary to keep you fit and working. <br /><br /><br /> Meditating will help you be more mentally stable if you are feeling low while working.

    article: 'Anything that your mind says has an identical response to the body cells. That’s why stress is the response your body gives physically or mentally to a challenging situation in your life, that response is dependent on how you think of the situation in your mind, that&apos;s why stress can be positive or negative. If we take things positively the symptoms lead to making you more productive actually. But in some conditions, the situation which we are in can be out of our control and at that time we have to maintain our responsibility towards it. <br /><br /><br /> <b>Mostly there are a lot of things and stressful situations that are going on in a teenager’s life which might be a reason to create stress like.</b> <br /><br /><br /> 1. In Schools, we might feel the pressure of exams and can lead to bad competition. <br /><br /> 2. But you have to make sure whatever you have selected should be unique. And it can be any topic in demand or which is a requirement for the people who live in your area so, the students will be excited to take part in the organization and school should also agree to your proposal. <br /> <br /> 3. Pressure from family for grades or other family issues. <br /> <br /> 4. Pressure to build new relationships. <br /><br /> 5. having toxic friends and relationships results in stress and less support. <br /><br /> 6. bullies and problematic teachers, etc. <br /><br /> all of these things cause a lack of confidence, anxiety, depression, and stress. <br /><br /><br /> A very very important thing to understand while handling stress is that we always take the reaction coming from stress as fear or anxiety, try changing this feeling with curiosity. For example, if you are in an exam hall and you are slowly starting to feel pressure and fear, and other symptoms of stress. OBSERVE, observe the reactions that your body is giving to you in this situation your heart is racing, hand sweating, etc. <br /><br /><br /> generate curiosity within, about how the paper will be good for you and how you will get good grades, this will help you control your reaction and bring it from dangerous to normal or healthy stress. Observe the things that you do which helps you to calm your symptoms and use them in other situations as well. <br /><br /><br /> In our teenage years, we have many changes happening in our daily life for the first time and we don’t know how to cope with these situations, because of this it is observed that teenagers experience stress and anxiety more. But in these worsened situations some teenagers go for the wrong side of coping with stress like drugs, wrong thoughts, etc. please don’t cope with your problems in a way that will damage your life there are other ways in which you can do so. And here are some methods that you can imply in your schedule so you minimize or cope with stress and enjoy your high school life. <br /><br /><br /> 1. <b>Visualize; </b> now if you know that situation is going to come where you can get stressed. You have to imagine yourself in that situation whether it feels bad to be in it and think how you will react or do the things in that situation. “First thing and then do it”. This will help you make a practice to cope with things and make them happen as you want them to be and control your reaction towards it <br /><br /> 2. <b> Organize; </b>many of us get overwhelmed by the curriculum we have to cover and we also cannot cope with time management when we have a lot of things to do, in situations like these you have to organize. This is the category where a lot of things fit so, <br /><br /> Start from small things like pack your things beforehand going to school or exam. <br /><br /> Make a task board where what you have to cover for a specific exam is written and color code it as per the difficulty level. <br /><br /> Make a timetable for busy schedules and cut on the classes or things that you think are extra. <br /><br /> Keep the place where you work organized. An organized workspace helps in clearing your mind and increasing productivity. <br /><br /><br /> 3. <b> Deep breathing; </b>Always helps deep breathing and self-talk make a great combination in stressful situations because we are the ones who can control ourselves. This helps us calm down more effectively in aggressive reactions by our parasympathetic nervous system (rest and digest function) which helps the sympathetic nervous system(flight or fight response) calm down. <br /><br /><br /> 4. <b>Exercise;</b> move yourself, staying in one place or doing the same things daily can frustrate us exercising and giving movement to your body is very important to keep your physical and mental state healthy. You can go for a walk outside or you can do different types of exercise like dancing, workout, running, athletics, anything that you feel joy while doing. Take out time from your schedule for things like this you can remove your one class or subject from the time you want to do these things but don’t burden yourself. <br /><br /><br /> 5. <b> Self-love; </b> if you are stressed because of bullying or people who make you feel low like toxic friends or body shaming, etc. First, learn to love yourself as you are, when you will love yourself what others say does not make any difference in your life. Do skincare, read books, go on a self date, cook your favorite food, be a plant parent, get a pet. These things will help you feel better. Don’t give those people any importance, what matters in your life is just what you think and decide to be. <br /><br /><br /> 6. <b>Talk;</b> suffering can be made easy by telling someone about it to someone. If we cannot find a solution to the problem the person who we tell can help. Also when we talk to someone and find that there is a sense of understanding between us we get to know that we are not only the stuck ones. Having someone standing to support us is a great thing and this can happen if you share what you think with others. try Including your family, friends, the people you love the ones you trust. <br /><br /><br /> 7. <b> Accept;</b> lastly, sometimes things are not in our control so accept the situation you are in don’t run away from it. Doing everything is not important doing the things that make you happy and giving your full potential to them is worth your time. <br /><br /><br /> These methods also help you to practically enjoy your high school life while relieving your stress, like for example, when you talk to someone share your feelings with them this will help you to make friends and discover people who have interests and problems like you. <br /><br /><br /> And at last here are the three E’s which you can imply in your high school life to enjoy it to the fullest. <br /><br /><br /> <b> Enjoying - </b> now we all have 1-2 or more things that we love to do it like a hobby, always keep taking classes or doing the things which you like along the excessive study schedule which is equal to maintain your interest in you school years <br /><br /> <b> Embrace the competition - </b> school is mostly about competition which might create stress but make it your way of doing things through HEALTHY competition don’t hurt yourself and others through that. <br /><br /> <b>Ending - </b> we always want things to end happily whatever the process is. For example, if you fight with your closest friend it is ok to not talk for some time but don’t only expect others to make things right you can be the one to take the first step and make your ending good. Because things like friendship are very important in school life'

    article: 'Intelligence and personality have always been inextricably intertwined with education. It is not just your grades or the number of AP classes that count as a part of your education, but also the skills that you gain from the non-academic and extracurricular activities you take part in. <br /><br /> In order to endure the pressures of the 21st century, today’s students, you all, must strike a balance between academics and extracurricular activities to avoid imbalance, which might lead to poor performance in one area while also leading to stress and anxiety in both. <br /><br /> I present to you some tips, based on personal experiences (so they are tried and tested, do not worry), that might help you answer this gruelling question. <br /><br /><br /> <br /> <b>1. Be sure to remember that extracurricular activities are always priority number 2 </b> <br /><br /> While admission officers at the university that you are applying to may be highly impressed by both, they are certainly going to hold your grades higher in regard to the number of basketball tournaments you have taken part in, for example. It is important to keep in mind that your priority number 1 should be achieving those target grades that you have set for yourself, and learn everything you can from your classes, before you think about expanding your knowledge base by participating in other relevant extracurriculars. <br /><br /><br /> <b>2. Choose extracurriculars that are relevant to your prospective career</b> <br /><br /> Quality is better than quantity, be it the friends you choose or the extracurricular activities. In this case, the most difficult part will be overcoming the paradox of choice and selecting only two or three activities (or more, depending on how talented you are!). Choosing every extracurricular that you come across may be tempting, however, it will take up a lot of your time, or perhaps you might be uninterested in most of them. It is vital to pick the extracurriculars that intrigue you, and those that will help you achieve your ultimate goal. <br /><br /><br /> <b>3. Create a schedule that works for you and manage time</b> <br /><br /> A schedule will help you prioritize your daily tasks and activities efficiently, and will offer you structure to support your productivity. A lot of your peers might have their schedules in place, and getting inspired by them would be helpful; however, each of us has our own study habits that work for us. Therefore, it is necessary to create a schedule around your style, in order to maximise productivity when it comes to both your academics and extracurricular activities. <br /><br /> When scheduling, be sure to decide a ratio for the time that you will devote to your studies vs your extracurriculars. Your class schedule and academics take the lead in the priority chart. Hence, schedule everything else around that. Participating in non-academic activities should always come after finishing your school assignments. <br /><br /> With that in mind, it is important to alter your ‘fixed’ and ‘usual’ schedule according to the circumstances then. For example, if you have exams coming up in a week, you should obviously devote way more time into studying, as compared to your extracurriculars. On the other hand, if you have a swimming tournament coming up, visit the swimming complex more in order to practice and smash your opponents! <br /><br /> In order to decide on a way to split your time to get the best of both worlds- studies and extracurriculars, try methods such as creating a to-do list and using a planner. Trust me, they do wonders! If none of that works for you, perhaps think about asking your mentor; it could be your high school teacher, sports coach, your parent/s or just someone you trust. Someone else might end up giving you some tips and tricks that you would have never thought of! (Do not forget to give them credit if their method works for you! <br /><br /><br /> <b> 3. Take breaks </b> <br /><br /> Studying too much, especially for lengthy periods of time, is just as bad as studying too little. Working in 45-minute increments with a five-to- ten minute break in between will allow you to stretch and refuel with a snack. As a result, you will maintain your concentration and will retain as much information as possible. <br /><br /> Apart from rigorously participating in the extracurricular activities that you need for your university resume, it is vital to refresh your mind by relaxing, or perhaps doing something that does not require too much effort from you. For example, you could spend thirty minutes a day listening to music, dancing in your room or meditating, in order to calm yourself down and prepare for upcoming events. Remember, even a charger heats up when used continuously. You are a human! Therefore, pause, take a break and then get back to work again! <br /><br /><br /> <b>5. Learn the skill of prioritizing</b> <br /><br /> Throughout this long article that you have been reading, the word ‘prioritize’ has been mentioned quite a few times and looks like something very important. By definition, prioritizing refers to the ability to determine the order for dealing with (a series of items or tasks) according to their relative importance. As stated numerous times above, you should decide which thing to devote your attention to. It is only you that knows how many pending assignments you have or how many football practices you have missed. Mastering both of these will require your passion, actions and most importantly, your time. Therefore, the decision is in your hands. As the famous educator, Stephen Covey once said, “The key is not to prioritize what’s on your schedule, but to schedule your priorities.” <br /><br /><br /> <b>6. Take care of your health</b> <br /><br /> You would not be able to study or participate in extracurricular activities if your health does not cooperate. Staying healthy is not just about being physically fit and active, but is also about keeping your mind and soul energised and happy. Sleeping well, exercising regularly and having balanced meals are some of the most basic things you can do to maintain your health. If these practices are in place, you will be able to both actively participate in your extracurriculars and concentrate on studying, leading to a much more organised schedule and environment. <br /><br /> It is said that organised surroundings lead to an organised mind. In a 2011 study conducted by OfficeMax, 90% of participants felt that cluttered workspace negatively impacted their lives, while 77% percent agreed that it negatively affected their productivity. However, in contrast, your organisational style could be similar to that of Albert Einstein or Mark Twain, whose desks were almost always cluttered; so that is for you to think about. <br /><br /> What I mean to say is that at the end of the day, it is you who has to deal with the opportunities you take up as tasks, leaving it to you to decide how to manage your academics and extracurriculars. Keep in mind that you are your best judge, and prioritizing one thing over the other, is completely your choice. <br /><br /> So, how will you balance this see-saw? Or will you even balance it?'

    article: 'You can feel it very easy if you just hold on and do nothing, the clock moves forward and the seconds are going away. This is what we call time and unfortunately it won’t stop running forwards, even if you try to make it go slower. This is the first part of a combination that causes the rise of a term called “time management”. The other part is today’s society and today&apos;s working world, where success means faster, better, bigger and more efficient. This caused a long search for how to use our time in the most efficient way we can. This period of time is named “productivity time”, which gains more and more importance. The internet is full of content about time management and tips about productivity. IN the following research paper (article) are listed some of the strongest regarding studies and real experiments. <br /><br /> <strong> 1. Be aware your time is limited</strong> As a first general step it’s important to know that your time is limited to 60 min an hour and 24 hours a day. You should be aware that the time you have will go over some day and you have mostly the free choice to do with it what you want. You can choose which tasks, activities and things you want to get done. In today’s world full of information and content on offline and online platforms, you also know that you can’t do everything, you have to decide which things are worth investing your time in and which not. You should invest your time in a way you are proud of and satisfied with. It requires a lot of time and effort to find the perfect balance between tasks you are emotionally satisfied with, but that maybe aren’t logical “productive” and tasks that are logical productive, but maybe aren’t emotionally satisfying you. If you don’t invest the time in finding the perfect balance, you won’t be satisfied anyway and that’s why you also will get less productive. This state of your mind you should definitely avoid, if you think about your time as one of the most important tools in life. <br /><br /><br /> <strong>2. Multiply your time</strong> When it comes to the question how we can “make” more time we firstly should know that our time is finite and we just can use it more efficiently or invest it more effectively. As Rory Vaden, a TED talk speaker says: “You multiply your time by giving yourself the emotional permission to spend time on things today that will give you more time tomorrow.”. What he means by this, that you should optimize the process respectively the way you do tasks, because if you invest time today in things that will optimize your progress procedure you can save time tomorrow at similar tasks. Another way to decide which tasks you should do, is to firstly eliminate the tasks you don’t need to do, then secondly automate the tasks you are not supposed to do in an active way and thirdly delegate tasks other people could do for you respectively you can get support with. In the end there will be the specific tasks you should do and invest your time in. This approach can save you a lot of time, by just thinking about the tasks and their properties and your opportunities to reduce the amount of tasks for you. <br /><br /><br /> <strong>3. Explore how habits can help you saving time </strong> Some tasks on your list are similar to others or maybe some of your tasks are long run tasks so, very easy tasks you have to do on a daily basis. Here habits can help you to get them done quicker and with a smaller amount of mental power to use. For example you could use a fixed time slot every day to just read and reply E-mails. Otherwise E-mails will distract you at your productive hours or even in your free time. Also you could plan a time slot in the evening to get an overview of the tasks you finished, so you can see what to add for the coming time schedules. <br /><br /><br /> <strong> 4. Understanding the “Hell yes or no” principle</strong> Another princip that can help you get not every task, but the most important done, is a principle called “Hell yes or no”. The basic idea is very easy, every time you get a task or someone asks you whether you could do a particular thing for the person you ask yourself the eponymous question: What do I think about this task? Is it an important, helpful, senseful or useful task - a “Hell yes” or is it an unimportant, time wasting or useless task - a “No”. This technique requires some practice decisions, but after them it will work great and save you a lot of time while just giving you the most important tasks to do. As mentioned in the previous point (Be aware your time is limited) your time is not endless, which means you are pressured to decide on which tasks to do, on the basis of which level of importance every single task has for you personally. It’s important to be honest to yourself, so you can say “No“ to tasks that maybe would be interesting but won’t fit in your time schedule no matter what you try to do. A big advantage of the “Hell yes or no” princip is the fact that it functions on every decision, no matter how big. This excludes some emotional important decisions, you should make independent of your time schedule. <br /><br /><br /> <strong>5. Using Parkinson&apos;s Law to keep tasks small </strong> One of the most famous tips when it comes to time management tips is a rule called “Parkinson&apos;s Law”. The main message of Parkinson&apos;s Law is the fact that a task willexpand to all of the time we estimated for it. If you want to imagine this princip you can think of itlike an “In task procrastination process”. If we give us a certain amount of time for a task we will think that this is way enough time, which will bring us to procrastinate for a huge part of the time. To beat Parkinson&apos;s Law you should estimate the absolute minimum time for a task so you can get it done in maybe half the time you would have wasted when not keeping the time slot small. Also when the estimated time is really too short you would have done a much bigger part than with no a small time slot. After a small practice phase Parkinson’s Law can give you the opportunity to get tasks in under 3 hours done, for which you needed the whole day before. Also you will develop a better feeling for your time and how much of it every single task will probably take. This can help you better plan your productive time slots. <br /><br /><br /> <strong>6. Prioritise your tasks</strong> As you know from the previous chapters, your time is limited and also dealing with the tasks you have to get done can be or probably is very exhausting, which is why you should learn to prioritize your tasks. There are many methods of how you can prioritize your tasks, so you have to test out some of them to find out what works for you. One of these methods is the “Eisenhower Method”, which describes the procedure of taking a piece of paper and dividing it into four parts while drawing one vertical and one horizontal line across the paper. In the first, you write every task that is very important and very urgent, provides a lot of value or any kind of award and has a near deadline. In the second area you write down every task that is very important, but not very urgent so you can do them later on. In the third area you write down the tasks that are not important, but very urgent, so you have to do them nearly. And in the fourth (last) area you write every task that is not important and not urgent, but still has to be done by you. These tasks you should only do if you have time on top. <br /><br /><br /> <strong>7. Plan your productive weeks, days and hours before they happen</strong> To improve your workflow it will help if you plan your weeks, days and hours before, so you know exactly what to do. This will give you the safety that you get done every task and also know what to do next, so you won’t end up in the evening realizing that you didn’t achieve anything or not enough. How exactly you plan your weeks, days and hours doesn&apos;t matter that much. It’s only important that you write down your tasks or structure in the form of a to-do list, time boxing plan or the numbers of what you have to get done. For example some articles you have to submit (to-do list), studying a particular subject at a fixed time slot (time boxing) or the amount of words you have to write daily for a paper you have to hand in (numbers of what to get done). A fixed plan will give you more structure for your productivity slots, which will cause bigger capacities for work (extending space on your to-do list). <br /><br /><br /> <strong> 8. Set a daily or weekly highlight</strong> As a specific form of prioritizing and productivity maximizing you can set yourself a daily or weekly highlight. The highlight should be the most important or urgent task you have to get done. This task will be the first to do before starting with others. The advantage of this technique is that you will be emotionally and logically satisfied when you get it done. It’s important that you don’t take a task as your highlight where you know it will take longer and won&apos;t be done in one day or week, because in the end of the day or week you won’t get it done so you will be frustrated, didn’t get done other tasks and won’t motivated to keep going. To avoid this result you should choose a task as your highlight that will be done in time for sure, so you can be proud of it after. <br /><br /><br /> <strong>9. Don’t underestimate breaks</strong> In today’s society nearly everyone is hustling for work on a daily basis and often breaks aren’t getting the attention and time investment which they deserve. Fortunately this problem is also known in the field of productivity which is why things like the Pomodoro technique, working for 25 (50) minutes and making a break of 5 (10) min and repeating that six to ten times a day, are implemented by many people. Instead of this technique it’s very senseful to set breaks in a way that fits into your workflow. Normally a human can stay in core focus for 25 to 45 minutes and at the latest after 55 minutes of core work you should take a break to avoid headaches and tiredness. Also breaks should only serve a way of relaxing like going for a walk, taking a power nap for 20 minutes or just drinking tea. So all in all breaks should definitely play an important role in your time schedule. <br /><br /><br /> <strong> 10. Find your daily peak productivity time period</strong> Which time slot provides the most productive time is different from human to human. Some like to work in the morning, some in the afternoon and others in the evening and late night. It would be very good for your time and sleep schedule if you find out which day time you like working the most. If you find out, you will be able to plan your day better. Independent at which day time you place your productive time block, you should sleep enough, meaning between 6 and 8 hours. Sometimes you can make exceptions and pull an all-nighter, but definitely avoid permanent sleep deprivation that would just knock you out for the next few days. Getting your work done in the early morning (5 - 12 am) has the advantage that you have nearly the whole day (afternoon) coming, which you can use for other activities. Working in the evening or at night (7 pm - 2 am) has the advantage that you won’t be distracted by friends or family members. Fortunately you have the opportunity to just try it and find out which period of time at the day fits you the most.'

    article: 'An organization is a group of organized people working on achieving a specific goal. Starting an organization, club, non-fund, anything is a great idea for achieving skills like leadership, time management, organization, etc., and gain a lot of good experience in your teenage years which will help in the future. <br /><br /><br /> But starting an organization includes a lot of inputs including your time, efforts, people, and many more things. You have to be mentally and physically prepared for all kinds of work depending on your goal. For example; contacting people, helping workers, taking permission, etc. Starting an organization is not going to be the easiest thing to do but with these tips, you will understand the process and this will make it easier to accomplish your goal of setting up a high school organization. <br /><br /><br /> For getting used to the way an organization works it is preferred to work in the organizations which are already available. This idea is just to get experience and be familiar with the strategies, work, etc. which you have to go through while forming your organization. This will also help you to get connected with like-minded people and will make a great difference. <br /><br /><br /> <strong>Here are steps you can follow to start your organization</strong> <br /><br /><br /> 1. The first and main step is to think of an idea about what initiative you want to have for the organization. Here are some genres for the topics which you can use; Practicing or learning a skill, creativity (music, dance, drawing, etc.), community service, fundraising, entertainment field such as film making, and there are many more. This step wouldn’t be included for the ones who have decided it before. <br /><br /> 2. But you have to make sure whatever you have selected should be unique. And it can be any topic in demand or which is a requirement for the people who live in your area so, the students will be excited to take part in the organization and school should also agree to your proposal. <br /> <br /> 3. Here at this point, you can also test the idea which you have selected to be the topic of your organization like; First of all, write a mission statement, you have to follow it makingtill the organization is working. And also in this test you can sit with your main team members for discussion and answer some of the following questions; Why have we started this organization? What is the demand among the people for this topic? Who is your target audience? Is your product or service truly going to address the issue? <br /> <br /> 4. Research the topic you have selected to gain more information on what type of activities you can conduct in the topic you have selected, etc. ask the locals, your schoolmates what do they expect for the organization because they are your target audience. <br /><br /> 5. Get a volunteer for your organization, now, in the school organization’s case you can find a teacher who is interested in the specific topic and help you with it, this makes a lot of difference when you have a teacher (authority) at your side. And collect your basic team with your friends who are interested in your cause or classmates to make a properly organized group which is the main purpose of the organization. <br /><br /> 6. Make your organization legal and official. As your group and volunteers are formed you can register your group officially to the school. If you have to do any document work required for your respective school or area you live in, ask the authority about the details and make them available. So now this won’t just be your thing but it will officially have some importance in your school/college life, and more people will know about this. <br /><br /> 7. Advertising is the part where you make it big. <br /><br /> Some of the ways of advertising are suggested as; <br /><br /> * You can create posters and banners for your organization and paste them on the notice board of your school/college. <br /><br /> * As you have a teacher volunteer they can promote and suggest students and even other teachers join your organization. <br /><br /> You can collaborate with other organizations that will help you to understand their strategies and people. and it’s never bad to have a big group and friends together whether they have different interests. <br /><br /> The most popular thing is social media right now among the youth. So, you can create your page on websites/apps like Instagram, Facebook, etc. <br /><br /> Last but not least contact your close ones to join the group or encourage them to promote people to join your organization. You can send invitations through email, WhatsApp, anywhere. <br /><br /><br /> <br /> <strong> Some of the main things to keep in mind for starting an organization can be as;</strong> <br /><br /><br /> 1. <b> The road of a thousand miles begins with one step.</b> So, When you are building an organization whether it is a big step we always have to start from small parts. Start taking small decisions, making small changes, and observing small things. And do not do many things together this may result in incomplete work and less effectiveness. <br /><br /> 2. <b> Don’t be afraid to talk to people,</b> be confident as you are the founder and leader of this group. You will have to contact a lot of people to spread the organization. <br /><br /> 3. Whether you are starting with small steps for first <b> keep your goals big don’t compromise in your goals.</b> Even if you are starting the organization from school this is the time you will have creative ideas and big insights and this can give you big success if done properly. <br /><br /> 4. <b> You have to be patient with the growth process of your organization.</b> No organization grows in one day or one week. It takes a lot of time to grow and be successful. You should just keep the good assigned work going. <br /><br /> 5. One more important thing is to <b> be consistent.</b> In many places, we observe that for the first few weeks the organization is very active but after that, there are no activities or enthusiasm furthermore. This affects the new members or reduces the number of people joining the organization. Each year new students take admission in the school so for the new students your organization should be as appealing as it was a few weeks ago for the old members.'
