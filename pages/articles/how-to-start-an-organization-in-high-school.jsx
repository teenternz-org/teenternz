    An organization is a group of organized people working on
        achieving a specific goal. Starting an organization, club, non-fund,
        anything is a great idea for achieving skills like leadership, time
        management, organization, etc., and gain a lot of good experience in
        your teenage years which will help in the future.
        <br /><br /><br />

        But starting an organization includes a lot of inputs including
        your time, efforts, people, and many more things. You have to
        be mentally and physically prepared for all kinds of work depending
        on your goal. For example; contacting people, helping workers,
        taking permission, etc. Starting an organization is not going
        to be the easiest thing to do but with these tips, you will
        understand the process and this will make it easier to
        accomplish your goal of setting up a high school organization.


        <br /><br /><br />

        For getting used to the way an organization works it is preferred to work in the organizations which are already available. This idea is just to get experience and be familiar with the strategies, work, etc. which you have to go through while forming your organization. This will also help you to get connected with like-minded people and will make a great difference.
        
        <br /><br /><br />

        <strong>Here are steps you can follow to start your organization</strong>
        <br /><br /><br />

        1. The first and main step is to think of an idea about what initiative you want to have for the organization. Here are some genres for the topics which you can use; 
        Practicing or learning a skill, creativity (music, dance, drawing, etc.), community service, fundraising, entertainment field such as film making, and there are many more.
        This step wouldn’t be included for the ones who have decided it before.
        <br /><br />


        2. But you have to make sure whatever you have selected should be unique. And it can be any topic in demand or which is a requirement for the people who live in your area so, the students will be excited to take part in the organization and school should also agree to your proposal.
       
        <br /> <br />

        3. Here at this point, you can also test the idea which you have selected to be the topic of your organization like; 
        First of all, write a mission statement, you have to follow it makingtill the organization is working. And also in this test you can sit with your main team members for discussion and answer some of the following questions;
        Why have we started this organization? What is the demand among the people for this topic? Who is your target audience? Is your product or service truly going to address the issue?
        

        <br /> <br />

        4. Research the topic you have selected to gain more information on what type of activities you can conduct in the topic you have selected, etc. ask the locals, your schoolmates what do they expect for the organization because they are your target audience.

        <br /><br />

        5. Get a volunteer for your organization, now, in the school organization’s case you can find a teacher who is interested in the specific topic and help you with it, this makes a lot of difference when you have a teacher (authority) at your side. And collect your basic team with your friends who are interested in your cause or classmates to make a properly organized group which is the main purpose of the organization.

        <br /><br />

        6. Make your organization legal and official. As your group and volunteers are formed you can register your group officially to the school. If you have to do any document work required for your respective school or area you live in, ask the authority about the details and make them available. So now this won’t just be your thing but it will officially have some importance in your school/college life, and more people will know about this. 


        <br /><br />

        7. Advertising is the part where you make it big.
 <br /><br />
        Some of the ways of advertising are suggested as;
<br /><br />
        * You can create posters and banners for your organization and paste them on the notice board of your school/college.
<br /><br />
        * As you have a teacher volunteer they can promote and suggest students and even other teachers join your organization.
        <br /><br />
        You can collaborate with other organizations that will help you to understand their strategies and people. and it’s never bad to have a big group and friends together whether they have different interests.
        <br /><br />
        The most popular thing is social media right now among the youth. So, you can create your page on websites/apps like Instagram, Facebook, etc.
        <br /><br />
        Last but not least contact your close ones to join the group or encourage them to promote people to join your organization. You can send invitations through email, WhatsApp, anywhere.
         
         

        <br /><br /><br /> <br />


        <strong> Some of the main things to keep in mind for starting an organization can be as;</strong>
        <br /><br /><br />

        1. <b> The road of a thousand miles begins with one step.</b> So,
        When you are building an organization whether it is a big step we always have to start from small parts. Start taking small decisions, making small changes, and observing small things. And do not do many things together this may result in incomplete work and less effectiveness.
        
        <br /><br />
        2. <b> Don’t be afraid to talk to people,</b> be confident as you are the founder and leader of this group. You will have to contact a lot of people to spread the organization.
        <br /><br />
        3. Whether you are starting with small steps for first <b> keep your goals big don’t compromise in your goals.</b> Even if you are starting the organization from school this is the time you will have creative ideas and big insights and this can give you big success if done properly.
        <br /><br />
        4. <b> You have to be patient with the growth process of your organization.</b>  No organization grows in one day or one week. It takes a lot of time to grow and be successful. You should just keep the good assigned work going.
        <br /><br />
        5. One more important thing is to <b> be consistent.</b> In many places, we observe that for the first few weeks the organization is very active but after that, there are no activities or enthusiasm furthermore. This affects the new members or reduces the number of people joining the organization. Each year new students take admission in the school so for the new students your organization should be as appealing as it was a few weeks ago for the old members.
