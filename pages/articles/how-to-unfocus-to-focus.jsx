        In this article we are going to tell you <b>how important it is to take a break and how to take an effective and
            productive break.</b> Now you are working continuously for a whole day, week, month, you have started
        working with your full energy and now as you do these things for a long time you feel exhausted you are in need
        of some recharge, this is the time you have to listen to your body and take a break.
        We all know that you have to sleep at night when you are awake for the whole day. It is decided in nature itself
        that taking a break is important. That&apos;s why doctors say you have to take 7-8 hours of daily sleep to function
        properly. We do this every day, so why not do it while we work or study.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <b>These are the reason why taking break is important ;</b>
        <br /><br /><br />

        1. We are not machines to work continuously and even these days machines like mobile phones, laptops, etc. need
        to be recharged when their battery exhausts. So, like we need food and water we need rest.
        <br /><br />

        2. It increases your productivity. You must have observed we feel really good in the mornings most of the time
        this
        is the result of taking a break.
        <br /><br />

        3. It is very important for your physical and mental health to take time out from your regular schedule and heal
        yourself from within.
        <br /><br />

        4. We get to observe the things which we cannot have observed in the rush of work. For example; when you are
        walking through a street in the morning to catch the bus you don’t see anything other than your goal, but try
        walking through the same path when you are free you will notice many beautiful things. And this is the way you
        enjoy your life from the small things around you.
        <br /><br />

        5. You get to recall the things you did or to understand the mistakes you are making in your daily schedule to
        find
        a better way to do things.
        <br /><br />

        6. This gives you time to take your hobbies other than your regular work and to do things you have wished in
        your
        bucket list if you are taking a longer break.
        <br /><br />

        7. If you are feeling stressed or have any mental health problems, breaks during the school or work helps you to
        calm yourself. This will make you think about all the situations and will give you time to work on this will
        make you stronger.
        <br /><br /> <br /><br />

        There is a technique naturopathy doctors tell their patients to do which is water diet, what is water diet
        basically giving a break to your digestive system to remove all the toxic/unwanted/harmful things from your
        body. So that this method helps the patient to heal itself from within. But it is strictly above 18 so don’t try
        it at home. Here, we have to take the importance of taking rest or having a break.
        <br /><br />
        <b> There can be many different types of breaks but here are three ways in which we will categories it based on
            the
            time it takes;</b>

        1. Short or minute= these kinds of breaks you can use while studying or working. Your brain can work
        productively
        for 45 minutes as per the observations. If we want to be productive for more than 45 min you have to take a
        15-20 min of break.

        <br /><br />


        2. Medium or weekly/monthly = this includes our weekly off during Sunday or any other day which your working
        schedule offers you or month ends. You have to use this day to give yourself complete rest and spend time with
        your family and friends, going somewhere nice to travel, etc. whatever makes you happy.
        <br /><br />


        3. Long yearly (bigger than a year if you need)= like academic breaks. Now, some people think academic breaks
        are
        just a waste of time. But they are needed not for everyone but for some people out there. So, if you want to
        take such breaks don’t listen to anyone and just take it because it might be important for you.
        <br /><br /><br />

        If you want to take a break but don’t know how to make it less lazy and more productive All these things listed
        from the first have ways you can take a productive and effective break hidden in them. But here there are more
        ways and also some things given above stated in a simple manner to do so.
        <br /><br /><br /><br />

        <b>1. Journaling </b> this will help you have a clear idea of things that you need to complete after the break
        is over and
        will help you think effectively.
        If you write about your feelings or events in the journal it will also help you be mentally stable and make you
        feel more happier when you will express your gratitude in it.

        <br /><br /><br />

        <b>2. Observe your surrounding </b>Go for a walk outside if it is a short break. If it is a long one, go for a
        small
        vacation. If you cannot do that either just sit on your balcony or any open space and observe this will help you
        breathe good air and be refreshed.
        <br /><br /><br />

        3. Now a scientific method for small breaks is taking caffeine. <b> Drinking coffee increases your energy
            level.</b> Also,
        eat something not junk but make it a bit healthy if you can go to a nearby restaurant or try a new café for
        change. Utilize your break to try new things around you.
        <br /><br /><br />

        4. Most people like to take a break by isolating themselves. You should also <b> try to socialize</b> with new
        people
        during breaks. This can make you understand people more and help you make new friends and gain opportunities.
        <br /><br /><br />

        5. You may also <b> talk to your friends or family </b>during that break. This will help you give time to your
        work and
        family, because many people fail to do these things they just get stuck in the work and forget about the family.
        Whether you are a teenager and live with your parents, build this habit of talking to the people in your house
        instead of scrolling through social media telling them your schedule and listening to their schedule. Take a
        social media break you know it’s benefits.
        <br /><br /><br />

        6. <b>Take a nap.</b> You can sleep for hours if it is a medium or long break but if you don’t want to do so,
        nothing is
        better than taking a power nap, find a good cozy spot in the house, set a timer on your phone for 25-30 minutes
        and sleep. This will help you to focus on your classes or work you are doing and won’t make you feel lazy during
        your productive hours. But don’t make it a habit.
        Exercise or meditation mainly keeps your body moving. Go for a walk, do a small yoga session, do whatever you
        like. If you are sitting in front of a screen or your book on the same spot for a long time this is necessary to
        keep you fit and working. Meditating will help you be more mentally stable if you are feeling low while working.
