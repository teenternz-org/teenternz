      p={<>Graduation is that time of your life where progression has started to come where new beginnings and the first chapter of your story would take off towards the aftermath of your school life. This could be a primary or secondary school. However, there is one part of evolution where teenagers are going through which is the aftermath of high school. Now, there are different perspectives coming from a graduate whether they have a plan or not. Generally, society has placed this mindset where once you have graduated from high school, your new chapter starts which is a university (or college). In some cases. it is not the same for others. A plan is evolved but it does not necessarily mean going to a university right away but a break from it which some label as “the gap year”.
      <br /><br />A gap year is defined as a year-long break where students use this chance to either take a break mentally or physically from school. It is also known as the sabbatical year where gap year students would enhance their skills through a series of open opportunities. This could apply after high school and college but in this case, it’s more of the aftermath from high school. Unfortunately, there are a lot of stereotypical profiles against being a gap year student. For instance, some would label them as “lazy” because of the lack of motivation they had over the past twelve to thirteen years of educational curriculums. Some would say that being a gap year student is just a “waste of time” because they are not benefiting the year/s they have left just to continue studying for the future purpose. These statements have been acknowledging by several people who shame students for not going to a university right away after their secondary education. However, there are emphasizes on why and how gap year is actually benefiting the students after high school. 
      <br /><br />But firstly, it is important to recognize personally why you think you should take a gap year? Being a gap year student has certain obstacles along the way and although it may be a break for your needs, there are some other reasonings for others to take such as possibly working, traveling, setting up a business, etc. There are countless opportunities when being a gap year student, hence, it is important to understand why you will need to take a break in the first place. Secondly, being in school for almost your entire life has been a challenge for most students especially to those who are dealing with personal struggles along the way. Taking the opportunity during the gap year would ensure the mental capability for handling further decisions in the future. Some would use the break to destress from all the work that needs to be produced such as recovering from the academic burnout that would be displayed on tests, quizzes, or homework. It is mentally and energy-draining which, therefore, students are recommended to take if necessary. Additionally, it gives them time to learn more about themselves and how would they benefit them in the future. Thirdly, other students take time to develop new skills possibly related to home education or work experience. As mentioned, they take some time to explore various opportunities that surround them to extend their knowledge about the society we live in. On certain occasions, it would also give others the opportunity to grow independent and to learn to cope up with what is needed for themselves. Thus, work opportunities or related experiences could enhance their skills which could benefit their resumes or other standards required in the upcoming fields. Lastly, this may be repetitive but taking some time for yourself such as determining your goals and how this could evolve you as a person may change some viewpoints from yourself. It is easy to get long in countless pages of your life thus, spending the time during the gap year could potentially help you determine what’s best for you by setting some goals. 
      <br /><br />The reasons for taking a gap year are beneficial towards a student who experienced countless burnouts or energy-drained issues that some schools have left them with. Taking a gap year before entering university could make a student increase their self-awareness or confidence as it would make them feel a sense of ownership in the future. It gives them time to reflect and understand their flexibility when handling time management. Taking a gap year is not fully easy for a student to comprehend as it will give them a better idea to understand the sense of being focused or in their own field. Their individuality and independence would make them stronger as they build their awareness towards going to a university. There have been surveys conducted coming from students who are taking a gap year. 98% have mentioned it had helped them with their self-confidence whereas 93% have increased their communication skills. These aspects helped each individual gap year student for growing further to develop their skills. Being a gap year student is not in all an issue, it is what makes an individual grow and prepare for what comes in the future. In fact, they can take as much time as they need to further develop because a college or university institution will still manage to be there. It will be there to develop others’ careers whereas gap year students could take the time they need. The pressure that comes along these individuals has given them a huge block on their backs that makes them carry throughout their lives. The stigma needs to end where individuals have the right to what is best for them and for their future, especially those coming from years of secondary school.
