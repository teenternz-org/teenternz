        also constrained by language problems and personality that they have not known each other. Not infrequently

        <br />
        • Fast response
        <br />

        <br /><br /><br />

        <b>2. Clearly Define Work Direction</b>

        <br /><br />
        Work direction is very influential on the productivity of team work. These team members can be held accountable
        for each of their respective performances.

        <br /><br />

        Some examples for clearly define work directions for build remote teams effectively:

        <br /><br />
        • Specific working hours every week
        <br />
        • Where they have to collect tasks
        <br />
        • Set deadlines for work
        <br />
        • Hold a meeting to get to know each other
        <br />
        • What platform will be used to communicate
        <br /><br />
        There are many ways to make performance process well and make sure all team members communicate well

        <br /><br /><br />

        <b>3. Maintain Communication Between Team Members</b>

        <br /><br />
        Communication breakdown of team members is very influential in productivity and quality of work performance. If
        you don&apos;t want that to happen, you must actively involve the founder and the team. How to do it?
        <br /><br />

        • Hold meetings monthly
        <br />
        • Check-in with individual
        employees

        <br /><br />

        Maintaining communication is the process of making sure everything is still on the page and can respond promptly
        to each other.

            3. Set up a Communication Platform
        </b>

        <br /><br /><br />


        Communication is the key to the success in the teams especially the long distance team, but it is also a
        difficult challenge.

        <br /><br />


        But in the digital era like now, everything is easy, you only need a signal and gadget service can already
        communicate with everyone, especially team members from all over the world.

        <br /><br /><br />

        <b>4. Communication</b>
        <br /><br />
        Remote communication eliminates visual cues and thus requires more effort to establish common ground. Unlike
        co-present partners, distributed team members cannot rely on gestures and facial expressions to direct the
        other’s attention and provide feedback on their understanding.
        <br /><br /><br />

        <b>5. Watch Your Language</b>

        <br /><br />
        It is not enough just to communicate either in the form of text or face to face. when they are in their
        respective zones so that they often hinder messages from a distance because remote work is not as easy as
        working in the office
        <br /><br /><br />

        <b>6. Provide Tools for Teams</b>

        <br /><br />

        Preparing the right tools can improve performance for the better. Providing software for teams remotely is
        important, but there is something even more important, do you know what? It is a necessary tool for individual
        work. Maybe it doesn&apos;t look so important but it will greatly affect the effectiveness of work.
        It&apos;s very important to make sure each team member has access to the existing tools or they want to set it up
        with their own account.

        <br /><br /><br />

        <b>7. Determine Work Schedule</b>

        <br /><br /><br />
        Determining the schedule is one way to determine the accountability of each member in realizing work
        expectations. In addition to making members responsible for their respective duties, this can also see the
        discipline of members in time.
        <br /><br />
        When just accepting a new remote member, the founder must pay attention and confirm each process and work
        expectations and then communicate them well and clearly to each team member. There are many things that can
        increase the productivity and effectiveness of a remote team but these eight steps are where it all starts.
        <br /><br />
        Advances from remote work add to the positive and negative aspects. And this is the reason why organizational
        founders strive to find the right tools to structure and distribute teams so that the organization will continue
        to grow. In addition, for many people working remotely is more comfortable because they are in their respective
        homes. Especially during the interview session, it feels easier than face-to-face interviews.

        <br /><br />
        Apart from these eight steps as a starting point for effective remote team building, there are also benefits to
        joining a remote teams, some of them are:
        <br /><br />
        • You can save money
        Because they work as a remote team working from their homes and using all the facilities they have free of
        charge.
        <br /><br />
        • Team members will be more productive
        Working as a remote team can choose the work they like and thus they will be easier, faster and enjoy their
        work.
        <br /><br />
        • You can access global talent pool
        Remote teams consist of people from different countries and cities, so when we join we can see the talents of
        different people and we can learn that so we will get new experiences.
