        Intelligence and personality have always been inextricably intertwined with education. It is not just your
        grades or the number of AP classes that count as a part of your education, but also the skills that you gain
        from the non-academic and extracurricular activities you take part in.
        <br /><br />
        In order to endure the pressures of the 21st century, today’s students, you all, must strike a balance between
        academics and extracurricular activities to avoid imbalance, which might lead to poor performance in one area
        while also leading to stress and anxiety in both.
        <br /><br />
        I present to you some tips, based on personal experiences (so they are tried and tested, do not worry), that
        might help you answer this gruelling question.

        <br /><br /><br />

        <br />

        <b>1. Be sure to remember that extracurricular activities are always priority number 2 </b>

        <br /><br />
        While admission officers at the university that you are applying to may be highly impressed by both, they are
        certainly going to hold your grades higher in regard to the number of basketball tournaments you have taken part
        in, for example. It is important to keep in mind that your priority number 1 should be achieving those target
        grades that you have set for yourself, and learn everything you can from your classes, before you think about
        expanding your knowledge base by participating in other relevant extracurriculars.

        <br /><br /><br />

        <b>2. Choose extracurriculars that are relevant to your prospective career</b>

        <br /><br />
        Quality is better than quantity, be it the friends you choose or the extracurricular activities. In this case,
        the most difficult part will be overcoming the paradox of choice and selecting only two or three activities (or
        more, depending on how talented you are!). Choosing every extracurricular that you come across may be tempting,
        however, it will take up a lot of your time, or perhaps you might be uninterested in most of them. It is vital
        to pick the extracurriculars that intrigue you, and those that will help you achieve your ultimate goal.

        <br /><br /><br />

        <b>3. Create a schedule that works for you and manage time</b>

        <br /><br />
        A schedule will help you prioritize your daily tasks and activities efficiently, and will offer you structure to
        support your productivity. A lot of your peers might have their schedules in place, and getting inspired by them
        would be helpful; however, each of us has our own study habits that work for us. Therefore, it is necessary to
        create a schedule around your style, in order to maximise productivity when it comes to both your academics and
        extracurricular activities.

        <br /><br />

        When scheduling, be sure to decide a ratio for the time that you will devote to your studies vs your
        extracurriculars. Your class schedule and academics take the lead in the priority chart. Hence, schedule
        everything else around that. Participating in non-academic activities should always come after finishing your
        school assignments.
        <br /><br />
        With that in mind, it is important to alter your ‘fixed’ and ‘usual’ schedule according to the circumstances
        then. For example, if you have exams coming up in a week, you should obviously devote way more time into
        studying, as compared to your extracurriculars. On the other hand, if you have a swimming tournament coming up,
        visit the swimming complex more in order to practice and smash your opponents!
        <br /><br />
        In order to decide on a way to split your time to get the best of both worlds- studies and extracurriculars, try
        methods such as creating a to-do list and using a planner. Trust me, they do wonders! If none of that works for
        you, perhaps think about asking your mentor; it could be your high school teacher, sports coach, your parent/s
        or just someone you trust. Someone else might end up giving you some tips and tricks that you would have never
        thought of! (Do not forget to give them credit if their method works for you!


        <br /><br /><br />

        <b>
            3. Take breaks
        </b>

        <br /><br />
        Studying too much, especially for lengthy periods of time, is just as bad as studying too little. Working in
        45-minute increments with a five-to- ten minute break in between will allow you to stretch and refuel with a
        snack. As a result, you will maintain your concentration and will retain as much information as possible.
        <br /><br />

        Apart from rigorously participating in the extracurricular activities that you need for your university resume,
        it is vital to refresh your mind by relaxing, or perhaps doing something that does not require too much effort
        from you. For example, you could spend thirty minutes a day listening to music, dancing in your room or
        meditating, in order to calm yourself down and prepare for upcoming events. Remember, even a charger heats up
        when used continuously. You are a human! Therefore, pause, take a break and then get back to work again!

        <br /><br /><br />

        <b>5. Learn the skill of prioritizing</b>

        <br /><br />

        Throughout this long article that you have been reading, the word ‘prioritize’ has been mentioned quite a few
        times and looks like something very important. By definition, prioritizing refers to the ability to determine
        the order for dealing with (a series of items or tasks) according to their relative importance. As stated
        numerous times above, you should decide which thing to devote your attention to. It is only you that knows how
        many pending assignments you have or how many football practices you have missed. Mastering both of these will
        require your passion, actions and most importantly, your time. Therefore, the decision is in your hands. As the
        famous educator, Stephen Covey once said, “The key is not to prioritize what’s on your schedule, but to schedule
        your priorities.”
        <br /><br /><br />

        <b>6. Take care of your health</b>

        <br /><br />

        You would not be able to study or participate in extracurricular activities if your health does not cooperate.
        Staying healthy is not just about being physically fit and active, but is also about keeping your mind and soul
        energised and happy. Sleeping well, exercising regularly and having balanced meals are some of the most basic
        things you can do to maintain your health. If these practices are in place, you will be able to both actively
        participate in your extracurriculars and concentrate on studying, leading to a much more organised schedule and
        environment.

        <br /><br />
        It is said that organised surroundings lead to an organised mind. In a 2011 study conducted by OfficeMax, 90% of
        participants felt that cluttered workspace negatively impacted their lives, while 77% percent agreed that it
        negatively affected their productivity. However, in contrast, your organisational style could be similar to that
        of Albert Einstein or Mark Twain, whose desks were almost always cluttered; so that is for you to think about.
        <br /><br />
        What I mean to say is that at the end of the day, it is you who has to deal with the opportunities you take up
        as tasks, leaving it to you to decide how to manage your academics and extracurriculars. Keep in mind that you
        are your best judge, and prioritizing one thing over the other, is completely your choice.
        <br /><br />
        So, how will you balance this see-saw? Or will you even balance it?
