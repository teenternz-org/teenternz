      p={<>In our lives, we all have experienced a certain trait that sometimes makes us feel stuck in one place. For instance, when trying to complete an assignment, you have the urge of possibly doing it later and just doing some other activity to keep your head out of it. This certain urge would be defined as procrastination, which delays a task to either put it off in a last-second or any other time before the deadline. Sometimes, procrastination could also be about persuading yourself to completely finish it off as it would be much beneficial for your time management. But the truth is, it is seemingly difficult to overcome it as there are loads of other activities to do instead of the initial task that you were supposed to do.<br /> <br />
      Procrastination often comes around when you’re doing a school task or any sort of work-related assignment. You were assigned to finish it before the deadline when suddenly your mind has told you that such task could be finished later on. As the youth of our generation, we have certain distractions that comes in our way, especially the idea of social media platforms and more modern technological advancements that includes the virtual and non-virtual spaces. Besides the evolution, we sometimes lack self-discipline where we often have a hard time controlling ourselves into doing something else. This could either be the cause of the lack of motivation or the pressure that we put ourselves into. <br /> <br />
      Sometimes, others identify procrastination as “laziness” which isn’t at all. Its mostly the desire of simply completing a task but could be difficult to maintain due to the time management skills or the causes that were mentioned above. As trying to balance your tasks, its also difficult to decide whether doing a task would be worth it, hence, you start to doubt that doing so would completely benefit you. This would be known as a decision paralysis where you often have a lot of freedom to make your decisions which could reflect your actions when doing your work. Procrastination is difficult to overcome as it ignores the value of time and the consequences you would get in the near future. <br /> <br />
      Although procrastination will live a long in our lives, there will be some occassions where we would have to go through it in order to productively finish the tasks that was either given to us or simply to get it done right away. Hence, to slowly fight over procrastination, here are some tips to go over it: <br /> <br />
      1. Time Management: As always, managing your time will benefit the situation by understanding the consequences that could happen if its done on time or not. Hence, try organizing a list or notes that could balance the tasks from a certain time period. For instance, organizing when and what time you should begin your tasks such as prioritizing it based on the significance and deadline it is. It is also important to take breaks in which you should keep in mind. <br /> <br />
      2. Minizime Distractions: Having to limit the distractions would help you focus upon doing your tasks such as closing off social media platforms, streaming services, and other activities that would distract you. To slowly limit them, you can start of by shutting them down by replacing with an easy task to finish within an hour. <br /> <br />
      3. Create a Planner: Although this is similar towards time management, creating a planner could possibly be planned a day, week, or month ahead in order to see what goes on during that time period. Thus, having planners such as a to-do list and a monthly planner would see the overall tasks that needs to be done within the deadline. You can either create a template for yourselves or use Canva, Goodnotes, and other Google templates to prepare so. <br /> <br />
      4. Have a Reward: Having to remind yourselves to constantly finish your tasks would be hectic but rewarding yourself in the end of the day would be the finishing touch of your duties. Thus, this could motivate you to keep going and to focus on completing your productive day! <br /> <br />
      5. Improve Your Routine: Lastly, improving your life style would benefit your productivity as it would create a healthy environment when trying to limit yourself from procrastination. Therefore, try sleeping early, eat properly, and prioritizing what needs to be done could help organize the essential activities. Planning this life style would not only improve your productivity but als your character. <br /> <br />
      Procrastination may be a difficult obstacle to overcome, but at the end of the day, it is just an urge that wants you to keep away from doing the productive tasks to go on. <br /> <br />
