    <p>The Stigma surrounding menstruation should end. Period.
<br />
                This International Women&apos;s Day, we choose to challenge the stigma surrounding menstruation.
<br />
                More than 800 million people in the world menstruate daily. Despite this, menstruation is plagued by
                cultural taboos, discrimination, lack of education and period poverty.
<br />
                The cultural shame attached to menstruation and the shortage of resources stop menstruators from going
                to school and work every day. Period poverty is the lack of access to sanitary products, menstrual
                hygiene education, toilets, handwashing facilities, and waste management.
<br />
                ‘Bleed Without Barriers’, is a student-led, non-profit organisation which will conduct regular drives
                for the underprivileged section of the society to provide them with sanitary products and train them to
                make their own cotton cloth pads using affordable means, and educate them regarding their proper
                disposal.
<br />
                We shall also work towards removing the stigma and misinformation surrounding menstruation. We will
                spare no effort, leave no stone unturned in bringing a change in our own ways. We firmly believe in
                feminism and condemn discrimination on the basis of sex, gender, sexuality, caste, creed, colour,
                religion, or any other prejudice. We want each woman to Bleed Without the Barriers of Society and with
                dignity!
<br />
                We are going to start our organisation in the capital of our country, Delhi. Delhi being one of the
                richer places in India still lacks the necessary resources required by a menstruator and we tend to help
                the ones in need and make sure that these resources are accessible to all.
