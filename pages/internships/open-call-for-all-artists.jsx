                directory of art open calls worldwide. With over 8,000 followers, including galleries, curators and
                museums â€“ the directory provides opportunities to those that are statistically underrepresented in the
                arts, such as women, LGBTQIA+, BIPOC, emerging, and low-income artists.</p>
