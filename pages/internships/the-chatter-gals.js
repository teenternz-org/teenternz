    <p>The 3 of us started the Chattergals community to introduce
                a much needed dialogue amongst us girls. We felt that as
                friends what we discussed on a daily basis amongst us, were
                actually topics which most girls find difficult to address.
                So we created this community to address all problems teenage
                girls go through and to provide a platform to discuss topics
                that maybe taboo and also the fun stuff. Hope we can make
                an impact in the world through this organisation!</p>
