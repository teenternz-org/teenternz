    <p>The Humanitarian Community is a collaboration of the minds and hearts. We work tirelessly to create an environment where we can share, learn, grow and change as a supportive community. Thus, allowing us to take the support that weâ€™ve been given and use that to help others: projects. The Humanitarian Community Team vets charitable initiatives that either help raise awareness, fundraise for or use simple methods to improve an issue. Every T.H.C.T. member takes on projects and collaborates with different organizations, to help ameliorate societal issues. An example of this is a charitable initiative that sets up places where those afflicted with homelessness can pick up care bags. We may not be able to solve homelessness or provide ample housing, but we can use this simple method to help improve quality of life, even if only by a small fraction. It does not fix poverty or solve homelessness, but it is something that can help people in a manner that seems so simple, but is extremely effective. Although we have not officially launched our website and our projects, we still have the potential to make great changes or at least be there for someone when they need it the most.</p>
