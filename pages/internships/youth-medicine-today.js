    <p>Youth Medicine Today or YMT is a student-led organization that strives to educate youth interested in
                the field of medicine and STEM. We educate our members on different specialties bi-weekly. 
                Our goal is to educate pre-med or STEM students on medical specialties through media, articles,
                and events to inspire and inform future physicians! YMT is also a member of the World Health
                Organization (WHO) Global Health Workforce Network. This partnership allows us to offer 
                exclusive events that only members of the WHOWN have access to</p>
