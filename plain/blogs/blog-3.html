        HOW CAN STUDENTS MAKE THE MOST OUT OF THEIR TIME?
    </h1>

    <br><br><br><br><br><br>

    <p id="Content">
        You can feel it very easy if you just hold on and do nothing, the clock moves forward and the
        seconds are going away. This is what we call time and unfortunately it won‚Äôt stop running
        forwards, even if you try to make it go slower. This is the first part of a combination that
        causes the rise of a term called ‚Äútime management‚Äù. The other part is today‚Äôs society and
        today's working world, where success means faster, better, bigger and more efficient. This
        caused a long search for how to use our time in the most efficient way we can. This period of
        time is named ‚Äúproductivity time‚Äù, which gains more and more importance. The internet is
        full of content about time management and tips about productivity. IN the following research
        paper (article) are listed some of the strongest regarding studies and real experiments.
        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

        <strong> 1. Be aware your time is limited</strong>
        As a first general step it‚Äôs important to know that your time is limited to 60 min an hour and
        24 hours a day. You should be aware that the time you have will go over some day and you
        have mostly the free choice to do with it what you want. You can choose which tasks,
        activities and things you want to get done. In today‚Äôs world full of information and content on
        offline and online platforms, you also know that you can‚Äôt do everything, you have to decide
        which things are worth investing your time in and which not. You should invest your time in a
        way you are proud of and satisfied with. It requires a lot of time and effort to find the perfect
        balance between tasks you are emotionally satisfied with, but that maybe aren‚Äôt logical
        ‚Äúproductive‚Äù and tasks that are logical productive, but maybe aren‚Äôt emotionally satisfying
        you. If you don‚Äôt invest the time in finding the perfect balance, you won‚Äôt be satisfied anyway
        and that‚Äôs why you also will get less productive. This state of your mind you should definitely
        avoid, if you think about your time as one of the most important tools in life.

        <br><br><br><br><br><br>

        <strong>2. Multiply your time</strong>
        When it comes to the question how we can ‚Äúmake‚Äù more time we firstly should know that our
        time is finite and we just can use it more efficiently or invest it more effectively. As Rory
        Vaden, a TED talk speaker says: ‚ÄúYou multiply your time by giving yourself the emotional
        permission to spend time on things today that will give you more time tomorrow.‚Äù. What he
        means by this, that you should optimize the process respectively the way you do tasks,
        because if you invest time today in things that will optimize your progress procedure you can
        save time tomorrow at similar tasks. Another way to decide which tasks you should do, is to
        firstly eliminate the tasks you don‚Äôt need to do, then secondly automate the tasks you are not
        supposed to do in an active way and thirdly delegate tasks other people could do for you
        respectively you can get support with. In the end there will be the specific tasks you should
        do and invest your time in. This approach can save you a lot of time, by just thinking about
        the tasks and their properties and your opportunities to reduce the amount of tasks for you.

        <br><br><br><br><br><br>

        <strong>3. Explore how habits can help you saving time </strong>

        Some tasks on your list are similar to others or maybe some of your tasks are long run tasks
        so, very easy tasks you have to do on a daily basis. Here habits can help you to get them
        done quicker and with a smaller amount of mental power to use. For example you could use
        a fixed time slot every day to just read and reply E-mails. Otherwise E-mails will distract you
        at your productive hours or even in your free time. Also you could plan a time slot in the
        evening to get an overview of the tasks you finished, so you can see what to add for the
        coming time schedules.
        <br><br><br><br><br><br>

        <strong> 4. Understanding the ‚ÄúHell yes or no‚Äù principle</strong>
        Another princip that can help you get not every task, but the most important done, is a
        principle called ‚ÄúHell yes or no‚Äù. The basic idea is very easy, every time you get a task or
        someone asks you whether you could do a particular thing for the person you ask yourself
        the eponymous question: What do I think about this task? Is it an important, helpful, senseful
        or useful task - a ‚ÄúHell yes‚Äù or is it an unimportant, time wasting or useless task - a ‚ÄúNo‚Äù. This
        technique requires some practice decisions, but after them it will work great and save you a
        lot of time while just giving you the most important tasks to do. As mentioned in the previous
        point (Be aware your time is limited) your time is not endless, which means you are
        pressured to decide on which tasks to do, on the basis of which level of importance every
        single task has for you personally. It‚Äôs important to be honest to yourself, so you can say
        ‚ÄúNo‚Äú to tasks that maybe would be interesting but won‚Äôt fit in your time schedule no matter
        what you try to do. A big advantage of the ‚ÄúHell yes or no‚Äù princip is the fact that it functions
        on every decision, no matter how big. This excludes some emotional important decisions,
        you should make independent of your time schedule.

        <br><br><br><br><br><br>

        <strong>5. Using Parkinson's Law to keep tasks small </strong>
        One of the most famous tips when it comes to time management tips is a rule called
        ‚ÄúParkinson's Law‚Äù. The main message of Parkinson's Law is the fact that a task will expand
        to all of the time we estimated for it. If you want to imagine this princip you can think of it like
        an ‚ÄúIn task procrastination process‚Äù. If we give us a certain amount of time for a task we will
        think that this is way enough time, which will bring us to procrastinate for a huge part of the
        time. To beat Parkinson's Law you should estimate the absolute minimum time for a task so
        you can get it done in maybe half the time you would have wasted when not keeping the
        time slot small. Also when the estimated time is really too short you would have done a
        much bigger part than with no a small time slot. After a small practice phase Parkinson‚Äôs
        Law can give you the opportunity to get tasks in under 3 hours done, for which you needed
        the whole day before. Also you will develop a better feeling for your time and how much of it
        every single task will probably take. This can help you better plan your productive time slots.
        <br><br><br><br><br><br>
        <strong>6. Prioritise your tasks</strong>
        As you know from the previous chapters, your time is limited and also dealing with the tasks
        you have to get done can be or probably is very exhausting, which is why you should learn
        to prioritize your tasks. There are many methods of how you can prioritize your tasks, so you
        have to test out some of them to find out what works for you. One of these methods is the

        ‚ÄúEisenhower Method‚Äù, which describes the procedure of taking a piece of paper and dividing
        it into four parts while drawing one vertical and one horizontal line across the paper. In the
        first, you write every task that is very important and very urgent, provides a lot of value or
        any kind of award and has a near deadline. In the second area you write down every task
        that is very important, but not very urgent so you can do them later on. In the third area you
        write down the tasks that are not important, but very urgent, so you have to do them nearly.
        And in the fourth (last) area you write every task that is not important and not urgent, but still
        has to be done by you. These tasks you should only do if you have time on top.


        <br><br><br><br><br><br>


        <strong>7. Plan your productive weeks, days and hours before they happen</strong>
        To improve your workflow it will help if you plan your weeks, days and hours before, so you
        know exactly what to do. This will give you the safety that you get done every task and also
        know what to do next, so you won‚Äôt end up in the evening realizing that you didn‚Äôt achieve
        anything or not enough. How exactly you plan your weeks, days and hours doesn't matter
        that much. It‚Äôs only important that you write down your tasks or structure in the form of a
        to-do list, time boxing plan or the numbers of what you have to get done. For example some
        articles you have to submit (to-do list), studying a particular subject at a fixed time slot (time
        boxing) or the amount of words you have to write daily for a paper you have to hand in
        (numbers of what to get done). A fixed plan will give you more structure for your productivity
        slots, which will cause bigger capacities for work (extending space on your to-do list).

        <br><br><br><br><br><br>

        <strong> 8. Set a daily or weekly highlight</strong>
        As a specific form of prioritizing and productivity maximizing you can set yourself a daily or
        weekly highlight. The highlight should be the most important or urgent task you have to get
        done. This task will be the first to do before starting with others. The advantage of this
        technique is that you will be emotionally and logically satisfied when you get it done. It‚Äôs
        important that you don‚Äôt take a task as your highlight where you know it will take longer and
        won't be done in one day or week, because in the end of the day or week you won‚Äôt get it
        done so you will be frustrated, didn‚Äôt get done other tasks and won‚Äôt motivated to keep going.
        To avoid this result you should choose a task as your highlight that will be done in time for
        sure, so you can be proud of it after.
        <br><br><br><br><br><br>

        <strong>9. Don‚Äôt underestimate breaks</strong>
        In today‚Äôs society nearly everyone is hustling for work on a daily basis and often breaks
        aren‚Äôt getting the attention and time investment which they deserve. Fortunately this problem
        is also known in the field of productivity which is why things like the Pomodoro technique,
        working for 25 (50) minutes and making a break of 5 (10) min and repeating that six to ten
        times a day, are implemented by many people. Instead of this technique it‚Äôs very senseful to
        set breaks in a way that fits into your workflow. Normally a human can stay in core focus for
        25 to 45 minutes and at the latest after 55 minutes of core work you should take a break to
        avoid headaches and tiredness. Also breaks should only serve a way of relaxing like going
        for a walk, taking a power nap for 20 minutes or just drinking tea. So all in all breaks should
        definitely play an important role in your time schedule.

        <br><br><br><br><br><br>
        <strong> 10. Find your daily peak productivity time period</strong>
        Which time slot provides the most productive time is different from human to human. Some
        like to work in the morning, some in the afternoon and others in the evening and late night. It
        would be very good for your time and sleep schedule if you find out which day time you like
        working the most. If you find out, you will be able to plan your day better. Independent at
        which day time you place your productive time block, you should sleep enough, meaning
        between 6 and 8 hours. Sometimes you can make exceptions and pull an all-nighter, but
        definitely avoid permanent sleep deprivation that would just knock you out for the next few
        days. Getting your work done in the early morning (5 - 12 am) has the advantage that you
        have nearly the whole day (afternoon) coming, which you can use for other activities.
        Working in the evening or at night (7 pm - 2 am) has the advantage that you won‚Äôt be
        distracted by friends or family members. Fortunately you have the opportunity to just try it
        and find out which period of time at the day fits you the most.
